# geo_cache_fun

This is a microsite that was built in a couple of hours (and at very short notice) for a friends reunion 
when we needed a last minute activity for the afternoon (to delay beers in the hottub).

Although it's not perhaps the most beautiful code ever, it's good fun and the theme of the weekend was 'back to basics'
so it fitted this very well
